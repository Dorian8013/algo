### Review these options BEFORE you run rAlgo, as they are very difficult/impossible to change after the server is deployed.

# Change default SSH port for the cloud roles only
# It doesn't apply if you deploy to your existing Ubuntu Server
ssh_port: 4160

# Deploy WireGuard
# WireGuard will listen on 51820/UDP. You might need to change to another port
# if your network blocks this one. Be aware that 53/UDP (DNS) is blocked on some
# mobile data networks.
wireguard_enabled: true
wireguard_port: 51820

# Reduce the MTU of the VPN tunnel
# Some cloud and internet providers use a smaller MTU (Maximum Transmission
# Unit) than the normal value of 1500 and if you don't reduce the MTU of your
# VPN tunnel some network connections will hang. rAlgo will attempt to set this
# automatically based on your server, but if connections hang you might need to
# adjust this yourself.
# See: https://github.com/rhdsx/ralgo/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md#various-websites-appear-to-be-offline-through-the-vpn
reduce_mtu: 0

# rAlgo will use the following lists to block ads. You can add new block lists
# after deployment by modifying the line starting "BLOCKLIST_URLS=" at:
# /usr/local/sbin/adblock.sh
# If you load very large blocklists, you may also have to modify resource limits:
# /etc/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service.d/100-CustomLimitations.conf
