# Deployment from Ansible

Before you begin, make sure you have installed all the dependencies necessary for your operating system as described in the [README](../README.md).

You can deploy rAlgo non-interactively by running the Ansible playbooks directly with `ansible-playbook`.

`ansible-playbook` accepts variables via the `-e` or `--extra-vars` option. You can pass variables as space separated key=value pairs. rAlgo requires certain variables that are listed below. You can also use the `--skip-tags` option to skip certain parts of the install, such as `iptables` (overwrite iptables rules), `wireguard` (install Wireguard). We don't recommend using the `-t` option as it will only include the tagged portions of the deployment, and skip certain necessary roles (such as `common`).

Here is a full example for DigitalOcean:

```shell
ansible-playbook main.yml -e "provider=digitalocean
                                server_name=ralgo
                                dns_adblocking=true
                                region=ams3
                                do_token=token"
```

See below for more information about variables and roles.

### Variables

- `provider` - (Required) The provider to use. See possible values below
- `server_name` - (Required) Server name. Default: ralgo
- `dns_adblocking` - (Optional) Enables dnscrypt-proxy adblocking. Default: false

If any of the above variables are unspecified, ansible will ask the user to input them.

### Ansible roles

Cloud roles can be activated by specifying an extra variable `provider`.

Cloud roles:

- role: cloud-ec2          [provider: ec2](#amazon-ec2)

Server roles:

- role: dns_adblocking
  * Installs DNS encryption through [dnscrypt-proxy](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy) with blacklists to be updated daily from `adblock_lists` in `config.cfg` - note this will occur even if `dns_encryption` in `config.cfg` is set to `false`
  * Constrains dnscrypt-proxy with AppArmor and cgroups CPU and memory limitations
- role: wireguard
  * Installs a [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) server, with a startup script, and automatic checks for upgrades
  * Creates wireguard.conf files for Linux clients as well as QR codes for Apple/Android clients

### Local Installation

- role: local, provider: local

This role is intended to be run for local install onto an Ubuntu server, or onto an unsupported cloud provider's Ubuntu instance. Required variables:

- server - IP address of your server (or "localhost" if deploying to the local machine)
- endpoint - public IP address of the server you're installing on
- ssh_user - name of the SSH user you will use to install on the machine (passwordless login required). If `server=localhost`, this isn't required.

Note that by default, the iptables rules on your existing server will be overwritten. If you don't want to overwrite the iptables rules, you can use the `--skip-tags iptables` flag.

### Amazon EC2

Required variables:

- aws_access_key: `AKIA...`
- aws_secret_key
- region: e.g. `us-east-1`

Possible options can be gathered via cli `aws ec2 describe-regions`

Additional variables:

- [encrypted](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encrypted-ebs-boot-volumes/) - Encrypted EBS boot volume. Boolean (Default: false)
